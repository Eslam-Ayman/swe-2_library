Library Management System:

The Library Management System may work as follows:
The system should serve its registered customers by introducing as many books as it can,
these books classified into sections,
each section may have subsections and each subsection may also subsections and so on.
The library should have a borrowing system that allow each customer to borrow
a free number of books per month as per his account type
(classic: 2 books, gold: 5 books, platinum: 10 books),
and his monthly fees specified based on his account type fees + any additional books borrowed fees.

All in all, the system may include the following functionality:

Membership management.
Order management.
